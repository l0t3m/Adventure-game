# 2D Adventure Game:
A simple 2D game created to practice design patterns in Unity.
Control a player who moves around the map, collect pickups and avoid enemies.
As your score increases, more enemies appear and start chasing you.


### Design Patterns:
- **Singelton** - for the Game Manager.
- **Observer** - for handling pickups events.
